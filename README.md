# GIS-DataScience_Pipeline

Using PySAL libraries and Tobler package to perform GeoSpatial Data Science on PostGIS-hosted data. We're performing these tasks exclusively through Jupyter NoteBoks.

This series of Jupyter Notebooks are going step-by-step though using Python's libraries in a database administration context. The first notebooks are in French, and they're also the most approachable. I'm picking from the results of the previous script to perform treatments.

## VS Code Setup 

## SQL use showcase

## PostGIS to GeoPandas 

## Tobler Spatial Intepolation



Feel free to give any feedback ! :)

Yours,

Adrien
